# Coding Interviews

This is a list of concepts I'd imagine it is important to learn in order to pass coding interviews at big companies and for jobs with really technical teams.

## Data Structures

- Array

- Hash Table 

- Linked List 

- Tree / Binary Tree

- Graph

- Stack

- Queue

- :octocat: **thejameskyle/itsy-bitsy-data-structures** - All the things you didn't know you wanted to know about data structures - https://github.com/thejameskyle/itsy-bitsy-data-structures

## Searching and Sorting

- Binary Search 

- Breadth First Search (BFS)

- Depth First Search (DFS)

- Counting Sort

- Quicksort

- Merge Sort

## Concepts

- Recursion: [JS interview prep: Recursion](https://tech.io/playgrounds/5422/js-interview-prep-recursion) (has runnable code examples)

- Dynamic Programming

- Greedy Algorithm 

- Big-O Analysis

## Learning Guides

- **Rithm School Computer Science Fundamentals with JavaScript** - https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript-computer-science-fundamentals - I've been following along with some of this as I don't have a comp sci degree. They explain the concepts and then point you to additional resources for learning the material (like youtub videos and specific codewars problems) Very helpful.

- **Coderbyte** - https://coderbyte.com/challenges/?a=true - Lots of programming challenges, access 10 for free otherwise $30 per month

- :octocat: **yangshun/tech-interview-handbook** - 4k+ ⭐ repo with helpful non-technical tips. Additionally has section covering Algorithm, Front End and System Design questions

- :octocat: **mr-mig/every-programmer-should-know** - https://github.com/mr-mig/every-programmer-should-know - Don't let the title scare you. This repo covers at a high level things ranging from *Career Tips* to *Data Structures*, *Security*, *Architecture* and *Algorithms*. It's a lot but can be helpful to overview concepts and find new things to learn

- :octocat: **jwasham/google-interview-university** - https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university#final-review - One man's somewhat crazy task to become a google software engineer. 48k+ stars. I believe he ended up working at Amazon. go figure

## Finding companies to apply to

- **https://whoishiring.io/** - Most impressive job site aggregator I've ever seen in my life. Scrapes all the boards and has a map of where every company is located.

- **https://huntr.co/** - Tool for keeping your applications and search organized on a Trello-style board. they also have a chrome extension for quickly adding jobs from various sources.

- **https://breezy.hr** - I used this one as a recruiter. It is actually built for HR departments but has a chrome extension and can be helpful for adding people and specific individuals you're reaching out to. This way you remember to follow up and can find like-minded people. One catch is that you need a custom email address like @your-domain.com. Signing up with your gmail account won't work.

- **https://betalist.com/jobs/collections** - companies and jobs grouped by category like *female led startup* or *decentralize all the things* for blockchain related jobs. 

- :octocat: **https://github.com/connor11528/sf-companies** - shameless plug here. I've got another repo going with companies located in downtown San Francisco. The data is available as a CSV file and includes company addresses.
