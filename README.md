# Coding Interviews

This is a list of concepts it is important to learn in order to coding interviews at big companies and for jobs with really technical teams. Not all companies interview this way but many do or at least include CS fundamental and puzzle questions as part of their processes. Preparing for these types of interviews can be challenging and tedious. I created this repo as a collection of resources to help better understand where these questions come from. There are tons of resources out there so if you are looking to crack the coding interview, well, definitely read cracking the coding interview (links below) and review some of the sites and concepts below. I also recommend [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) for doing live practice interviews to get you prepared.

If you have feedback for the repo or are looking for help on job search (interview prep, resume review etc) shoot me an email: connorleech@gmail.com or [tweet connor11528](https://twitter.com/connor11528)

They explain the concepts and then point you to additional resources for learning the material (like youtub videos and specific codewars problems) Very helpful.

- **Coderbyte** - https://coderbyte.com/challenges/?a=true - Lots of programming challenges, access 10 for free otherwise $30 per month

This repo covers at a high level things ranging from *Career Tips* to *Data Structures*, *Security*, *Architecture* and *Algorithms*. It's a lot but can be helpful to overview concepts and find new things to learn

- **https://huntr.co/** - Tool for keeping your applications and search organized on a Trello-style board. they also have a chrome extension for quickly adding jobs from various sources.

- **https://breezy.hr** - I used this one as a recruiter. It is actually built for HR departments but has a chrome extension and can be helpful for adding people and specific individuals you're reaching out to. This way you remember to follow up and can find like-minded people. One catch is that you need a custom email address like @your-domain.com. Signing up with your gmail account won't work.

- **https://betalist.com/jobs/collections** - companies and jobs grouped by category like *female led startup* or *decentralize all the things* for blockchain related jobs.
